            Hi, I’m Jenn and welcome to my portfolio site! I’m in the process of completing a masters degree in computer science, with a focus on machine learning, 
            so the projects you will find here are often inspired from things I am currently learning. 
            I love thinking about how to apply data science and machine learning to pressing global issues or ways to improve human life.
            Feel free to reach out if collaborating on projects would be interesting to you!</span>
